# Coding Test: Important Hashtags

Using the documents in the `test-docs` folder, find the most commonly occuring words (or "Most Important Hashtags").

Your solution should include a programmatic interface (CLI, API, Seldon Deployment, etc) that creates the following output sorted by the most important words:

+-------+-----------------+------------+
| Word  |   Sentences     | Documents  |
+-------+-----------------+------------+
| w1    | s1, s2, s3, s4  | d1, d2     |
| w2    | s3, s4, s5      | d2, d3, d4 |
| …     | …               | …          |
+-------+-----------------+------------+

This is an example, you have the flexibility to modify the final output as you wish.

The idea is to build a reusable solution which can be extended to other documents and text sources.

Please feel free to include a README.md file with any relevant information related to your solution.
